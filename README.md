- 👋 Hi, I’m @brayanorjuela
- 👀 I’m interested in Data Science, especially the application of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence to solve real-world problems.
- 🌱 I’m currently improving my SQL skills to be able to more efficiently obtain access to valuable information stored in data bases, as well 
- as I am learning TensorFlow for the developement and deployment of machine learning algorithms. Furthermore, I am learning new strategies 
- to use python as efficiently as possible. In the near future, I would also like to learn Tableau and Apache-Hadoop.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on data science projects
